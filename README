=========

This is a small set of helper scripts that extend git with some extra
commands. In particular:

  - git ls-objects --- List *all* the objects in the repository.
    (ls-objects uses logic suggested by '' on StackOverflow)

  - git merge-into <branch> --- Create a new (non-fast-foward) merge commit
    on the specified branch, which merges HEAD into it. This is only
    possible in cases where the merge *could* be done as a fast-forward.
    (merge-into uses logic suggested by '' on StackOverflow)

  - git xbranch [options] --- A more informative branch listing, to use when
    'git branch' doesn't give enough information. xbranch shows how each
    branch relates to its tracking (upstream) branch (up-to-date/ahead/
    behind/diverged, and how far, counted in commits); alternatively, it
    can show the relation of each listed branch to a commit specified on
    the command line. It lists local branches by default, but can also list
    all branches (-a) or remote branches (-r), or remote branches for one
    specified remote (-r<remote name>).

Other scripts in this repository (git-meld and meld-for-git) are irrelevant
for most git installs, particularly recent gits which have built in support
for running meld. bin/git-meld hard-codes a path that won't work for anyone
else.

The scripts are released under the GNU General Public License, version 3,
a copy of which is included in the file `COPYING'.

Some scripts include logic which was provided by users on StackOverflow.
These are attributed in comments in the scripts.

The scripts (in bin/ in this repository) should be installed in

 /usr/lib/git-core

so that they will be found by git.
